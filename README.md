- 👋 Hi, I’m @cloudallen
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics, its applications and methods in computer science and data analysis for their use on statistics and other math areas.
- 🌱 I’m currently researching abstract algebras, specifically the Theory of Representations of Lie Algebras, on my spare time I do quite a bit of coding in Haskell, Python and JS for pet projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any pure mathematical library, as well as data analysis projects pertinent to some personal interests, such as education, geography and finances.
- 📫 You can find me through my e-mail cloudallen.melo@gmail.com or through my discord cloudallen#0214.
